# C_Block

This project was just a quick implementation of a block chain in C++. It is not distributed and not fully
featured it is just an implemetation to hack on in my free time.

## Getting Started

To get started hacking on this simply clone the repo and build the executable

### Prerequisites

You dont need much just a c++ compiler working from linux I use g++ 

## Cool things you can do
-implement a difficulty factor for the hash
-create a menu 
-put the blockchain online
-create custom hashing functions
